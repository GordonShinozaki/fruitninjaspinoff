Short Project To Make a Hand-Controlled OpenCV Game using MediaPipe

## What To do

1. Activate a python virtual environment so you don't mess with your current env 
2. Run pip install -r requirements.txt in the project folder 
3. run main.py 

And you're good to go!

## Game Rules 
1. Slice the fruits, not the bees! Got a heavy penalty waiting for you if you do
2. Oranges < Watermelons, cos, well, I don't like oranges so much

Have fun!
